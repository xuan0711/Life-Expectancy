# Follow-up Questions

### New Questions Based Off Initial Investigation

- Q1: Does the relationship between UHC and crude suicide rates change when gender is a factor?
- Q2: What is the distribution of medical doctors look like? Is the distribution of medical doctors related to the transition in the chart"Medical Doctors vs Alcohol Substance Abuse"?
- Q3: WHAT IS THE DISTRIBUTION OF CHANGES IN THE HEALTHCARE INDEX? HOW MUCH DOES IT TEND TO VARY?
- Q4: WRITE_QUESTION_HERE

# Summary

GIVE A 2 PARAGRAPH SUMMARY. 

PARAGRAPH 1 SHOULD DESCRIBE WHAT YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOUR DATA FROM INVESTIGATING THE INITIAL QUESTIONS. DID YOU FIND ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN YOUR DATA? DID ANYTHING SURPRISE YOU? WHICH OF THE INITIAL QUESTIONS WERE HELPFUL IN LEADING YOU TO MORE QUESTIONS?

-Kevin Lu:
-The data showed surprising results for the initial questions. I observed a positive correlation between universal health coverage and crude suicide rates, which I had expected to be a negative correlation. I also observed a negative correlation between alcohol consumption and road traffic deaths, which I had expected to be a positive correlation. 
-Julia Yu: 
-My data and plots showed me surprising results for the initial questions. I had assumed that the increase of alchohol abuse would lead to a negative influence on life expectancy. The woman group showed a stronger positive relationships. However, the first plot showed a positive relationship. So I questioned if the increasing of medical doctors would affect these two variables. As medical doctors increases life expectancy tend to be stable, while for alcohol abuse, the pattern is quite ambiguous.
-Jessica Barta
-Croatia increased healthcare coverage the most (+11) while Ireland and Nepal decreased their coverage the most (-3). Most countries didn't see much change in their coverage between 2015 and 2017, because the standard deviation was low, about 1.7.

PARAGRAPH 2 SHOULD SUMMARIZE WHAT YOU LEARNED FROM INVESTIGATING THE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS. WHY ARE THESE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS INTERESTING FOR INVESTIGATION? DESCRIBE THE TABLES/FIGURES YOU USED TO EXPLORE ANSWERS TO THESE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS? WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THE TABLES/FIGURES REGARDING THE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS YOU PROPOSED?
-Kevin Lu:
-The follow up question explored the relationship between universal health coverage and crude suicide rates while considering gender as a factor. The new figure showed that the positive correlation observed in the initial question is almost entirely due to a strong positive correlation for males, while there was little to no change for females based on universal health coverage. The figure also provides insight that female suicide rates are much lower than male suicide rates overall.
-Jessica Barta
-Most countries didn't see much change in their coverage between 2015 and 2017, based on the low standard deviation, about 1.7, and boxplot showing little variation. There were only a couple outliers noted above. The lack of variation brings up questions about how healthcare coverage was measured. Should the WHO have used a more sensitive measurement that would pick up more variation? It seems unlikely that nearly all the countries surveyed changed very little, or the same amount, over time.
-Julia Yu
-Most average medical doctors values are between 0 and 30. And I found the mean is about 20.685. In the chart "Medical Doctors vs Alcohol Substance Abuse", the transtion occurred at around x=20 (average medical doctors). Therefore, as the average medical doctors approximately reach to the mean, the life expectancy tend to be stable.
